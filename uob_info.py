The University of Balamand (UOB) is a private, non-profit, independent Lebanese institution of Higher Education.

UOB was founded in 1988 by the Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East upon the direction of Patriarch Ignatius IV.

The University's main campus is located in Balamand, El-Koura, Lebanon, on a scenic hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea and the city of Tripoli.

UOB also has three other campuses across Lebanon: Dekwaneh (Beirut), Souk El Gharb, and Beino (Akkar).

The main campus occupies a suburban area of approximately 550,000 square meters.

The University is affiliated with the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch but operates as a quasi-secular institution.

UOB welcomes students from all faiths and national or ethnic origins without discrimination based on religion, gender, or physical handicap.

The University commits itself to Christian-Muslim understanding, openness, tolerance, and compassion.

The University offers curricula leading to degrees in more than 71 undergraduate majors.

UOB maintains an academic framework largely following the American model of higher education.

The primary language of instruction at the University is English.

The Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (ALBA), which predated the university, conducts its programs mainly in French.

The degrees granted by the University of Balamand are recognized worldwide.

The UOB includes 10 Faculties and one Institute, such as the Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, and Acad√©mie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts (ALBA).

The University system includes five libraries, with the main one being the Issam Fares Library Learning Center.
